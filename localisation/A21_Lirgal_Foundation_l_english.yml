 lirgal_happs.1.t: "Rumours of a Caravan"
 lirgal_happs.1.d: "Rumours of a caravan have travelled the countries of Alteniquia. Coming from the continent of Syltör, it seems to be made of a variety of peoples, all following a similar creed and faith. On their way, they have befriended and traded with all Alteniquians, but quickly left every city and town they passed through."
 lirgal_happs.1.a: "A most curious happening."
 lirgal_happs.1.a.tt: "The Second Seraan caravan travels through Alteniquia, hoping to find a new land to inhabit."
 lirgal_happs.t.201: "The demand of the Lirgalyn"
 lirgal_happs.d.201: "Though people talk of Meydan with no end, everyone knows that Meydan is no better than a wasteland. Moreover, a group of new peoples has settled in its land - they claim to have found ruins of a city of yore that belonged to them, and wish to develop the land."
 lirgal_happs.2.a: "Pah! That land is more trouble than it's worth, either way. Let them have it!"
 lirgal_happs.2.b: "A new city arises? That will probably turn out better than this mess ..."
 lirgal_happs.2.c: "Let the Lirgalyn have their land. There is no harm in giving, sometimes."
 lirgal_happs.2.d: "May the Lunar City-State of Lirgal thrive!"
 lirgal_happs.2.e: "A new city, and it demands autonomy? Perhaps - but we shall limit it."
 lirgal_happs.2.f: "A new city arises. Glory to the City of Lirgal."
 lirgal_happs.2.g: "Those are [Root.GetAdjective] lands and they shall remain [Root.GetAdjective] lands!"
 lirgal_happs.4.t: "Lirgal calls for aid!"
 lirgal_happs.4.d: "A delegate from the lunar city-state of Lirgal arrives at our doorstep, panting and on the verge of tears; beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], they say, Lirgal is under attack - and they need our support. Carefully unrolling the parchment they carry, it reads as following.\n\n 'Forgive our haste with this missive, but you must understand that the situation is urgent. Merely a couple days ago, foreign agents entered our borders, seeking to subjugate us, destroy our culture and raze our city - long have we known each other, and we will only ask this of you once: help us curtail these invaders, and we will perpetually be in your debt.\n\n Signed, The Lunar Council.'"
 lirgal_happs.4.a: "We have no choice but to accept."
 lirgal_happs.4.b: "They can deal with it themselves."
 redCultSac.1.a: "woah"
 redCultSac.1.b: "ok"
