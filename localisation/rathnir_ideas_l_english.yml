 A00_council_of_elders: "Council of Elders"
 A00_council_of_elders_desc: "When we began to spread our wings over Rathnir, it became obvious that our old Jagdasian provincial system would fail. Instead, we have devised a system in which the eldest- and thus wisest- member of each town will act as a courier between us and our far-flung provinces. Their pride lets us pay them less, if nothing else."
 A00_bandit_captain_recruitment: "Bandit Captain Recruitment"
 A00_bandit_captain_recruitment_desc: "Bandits plagued us in our early days in Rathnir. Most nations developed some sort of militia to fend them off, but where they saw an enemy we saw an opportunity. By integrating bandit captains into our chain of command, we pacify our enemies and turn them into our allies. So what if it makes the people uneasy?"
 A00_establish_the_urdussad: "Establish the Urdussad"
 A00_establish_the_urdussad_desc: "Yimmu-Audal has always known religious freedom, even in during the occupation. However, as religions grow more complex and centralized, we have decided to create a council of loyal priests in our realm to lead their flocks within Yimmu-Audal, as to reduce foreign influence."
 A00_lily_fleet: "Lily Fleet"
 A00_lily_fleet_desc: "Despite our maritime nature in Jagdas, we had all but abandoned naval affairs once we began our more continental empire here on Rathnir. With the capture of the Lily Fleet from the Escharians, though, a new zeal for naval dominance has found us."
 A00_horse_reacquisition: "Horse Reacquisition"
 A00_horse_reacquisition_desc: "Horses are an invaluable resource. Messengers, beasts of burden, cavalry, their uses are everywhere and obvious. Let us nationalize them all, so as to ensure we and we alone decide where they are used."
 A00_the_glory_of_urnu-arrak: "The Glory of Urnu-Arrak"
 A00_the_glory_of_urnu-arrak_desc: "There is no city greater than Urnu-Arrak. The Silver Citadel lies tarnished, Lileanen flooded, Hapatmitas a ghost town, Dorasterrock's markets bare, and Aezenfjord more a nature reserve than a settlement. Urnu, however, stands as splendid as ever. Let us allocate more of our workforce to make it even more grand."
 A00_cutting_tongue: "Cutting Tongue"
 A00_cutting_tongue_desc: "All rulers fear an Audalad diplomat, for there are none whose tongues are quicker or more cutting. For every lash of their tongue, it is said that ten thousand wounds are placed upon your reputation."

 A01_trading_in_the_ombra_gulf_desc: "Ayesinco is situated on a peninsula of the same name, which conveniently juts out into the heart of the trade-rich Ombra Gulf. Many a wise merchant have been made rich off of its trade, and it is high time for the state to do the same."
 A01_desert_warfare: "Desert Warfare"
 A01_desert_warfare_desc: "Theiónikos is, for better or worse, primarily in the desert. This does mean, however, that our troops are much more adept at surviving the often-harsh sun. Why fight if we can instead watch our enemies simply lose themselves to the sand?"
 A01_host_the_swordgames: "Host the Swordgames"
 A01_host_the_swordgames_desc: "When the Red Cult was still rampant in our lands, they held bloodsports as part of their human sacrifices. While we have since banned the more sacrificial elements of the games, we now have a class of semi-professional gladiators. Perhaps we should integrate what remains of these games, so that we have more war-ready men to pull from?"
 A01_granary_of_the_phagosian: "Granary of the Phagosian"
 A01_granary_of_the_phagosian_desc: "We may be a desert, but the Gebel river's banks are perhaps the most productive on the Phagosean. Let us exploit this niche, export grain on the very river it is grown on."
 A01_riders_across_the_dunes: "Riders across the Dunes"
 A01_riders_across_the_dunes_desc: "The desert is our home, and has been since the Lausarii tribesmen settled here centuries ago. Woe to anyone who tries to fight us here, for we know our home, and our home is more than happy to aid in its defense."

 A03_for_monath_desc: "While Monáth was subsumed into the ranks of the Theiosist angels long ago, many Astyllean islanders still revere Monáth alone. Our priests embrace this, for Monáth is our patron and eternal defender from wrath both divine and infernal."
 A03_noblesse_oblige: "Noblesse Oblige"
 A03_noblesse_oblige_desc: "No Táloran nobleman would be caught dead being impolite or unwelcoming. Indeed, nobles who fail to meet the high standards of conduct are treated as a social anathema."
 A03_supreme_engineers: "Supreme Engineers"
 A03_supreme_engineers_desc: "There are no greater engineers than the engineers of Tálor! Or, at least, that's what the Tálorans would say. Given the Pillars of Tarad-Elarae and the many great palaces dotting the Astyllean coastline, few attempt to challenge them."
 A03_masters_of_the_astyllean: "Masters of the Astyllean"
 A03_masters_of_the_astyllean_desc: "From the very foundation of our kingdom after the fall of Hraam, Tálor has held undisputed control of the Astyllean. Even when Tálor was under Yimmu-Audal's rule, wise ships knew to fly Táloran colors when passing our shores."
 A03_new_ordinances: "New Ordinances"
 A03_new_ordinances_desc: "In 1666 ASC King Antares Rochelle, frustrated with disorganized and inefficient fishing methods, began enforcing the Cod Laws. These delineated strict regulations for when, where, and how fish could be caught, stored, and sold."

 A03_aurdiann_mead: "Aurdíann Mead"
 A03_aurdiann_mead_desc: "The Aurdíann family has a long history in Vortakor. Commonly believed to have founded the city soon after the end of the Hraamic empire, the Aurdíanns are renowned for their mead. By using the same equipment for centuries the casks of Vortakor produce a truly irreplicable flavor, developed over generations of careful brewers. From Athazolant to Serafini, no cellar is complete without a bottle."

 A07_a_yellow_memory: "A Yellow Memory"
 A07_a_yellow_memory_desc: "Despite our estrangement, the people of Coltmaere are closely related to the Bardonians and Ryzani. Perhaps we could learn a thing or two from their warrior spirit..."
 A07_keshnev_trade_union: "Keshnev Trade Union"
 A07_keshnev_trade_union_desc: "Keshnev was founded as a trading colony of the Valdreach Imperial Republic. Our contacts from this period remain intact, allowing us to trade along far-off trade routes."
 A07_legacy_of_the_witch-hunts: "Legacy of the Witch-Hunts"
 A07_legacy_of_the_witch-hunts_desc: "While we no long hunt witches and other evil sorcerers, all magic practitioners in our land know that the law remains in effect. If nothing else, it puts the people at ease."
 A07_phagosian_ferries: "Phagosian Ferries"
 A07_phagosian_ferries_desc: "Coltmaere's islands are small, numerous, and far flung. To this effect, Coltmaeran boats are fast and made for efficient transport. If only this made them better in battle..."
 A07_hjuzairar: "Hjuzairar"

 A07_iceshapers: "Iceshapers"
 A07_iceshapers_desc: "Keshnev's ice shapers are strange indeed. They turn summer heat into winter snow, and claim to see the future in the ice... Despite our nominal ban on witchcraft, it may be wise to sanction their divination practices."

 carn_ideas: "Carnian ideas"
 carn_ideas_start: "Carnian Traditions"
 carn_ideas_bonus: "Carnian Ambition"
 carn_lestrian_red: "Lestrian red"
 carn_lestrian_red_desc: "Many nations around the world lay claim to their own drinks and cuisine, but even among red wines Lestrian red is said to be unique. Brewed and fermented from the grapes that naturally dot the Carnian and Reyllean plains, it is a dark, hardy wine suited for the strongest of warriors - yet, simultaneously, it is slightly sweet, and bitter but not too bitter, falling into that perfect sweetspot that so many other wines and winemakers around the world wish they had achieved."
 carn_the_old_cults: "The old cults"
 carn_the_old_cults_desc: "No one exactly knows where the traditions, ideas and values that build the foundation of Aegmerism come from - and if they do, it’s likely that they’re atleast partly lying. Though the religion itself is not too old in comparison with some of its counterparts along the continent, certain signs point to it being much older than we all can definitively prove. Within Carn this more often than not leads to certain strife regarding canonicity and historical rulers, but outside it? Well, it certainly gives a certain sense of prestige and legitimacy, legitimacy that has a minor  but noticeable effect on the heretics around Carn."
 carn_lantine_legacy: "Lantine legacy"
 carn_lantine_legacy_desc: "Within the history scrolls, Lant - these days more often known as saint Allantus - is identified as the first ruler of the Caeronate of Carn, several centuries in the past. Being the first ruler, his ideas and values hold a certain sway over the more modern Caerons, who look back to him and his immediate successors with optimism, hope, and as signs of better times. Or, when times are good, examples that can be pointed to in order to drive home the point that those good old times never really faded."
 carn_the_erneraevis: "The Erneraevis"
 carn_the_erneraevis_desc: "The Erneraevis - the elite core unit of the Carnian army - is like no other. Trained from birth to be loyal servants of the Caeron serving him faithfully until death, they do not know the word dishonor and would gladly take their own lives if it meant the Caeron lived, something that can’t be said for most normal soldiers. Within the army they strike fear on the battlefield, and at home they can often be seen in their secondary role as protectors of the Caeron himself, walking alongside him on the streets as his personal guards at all times."
 carn_port_of_lestria: "Port of Lestria"
 carn_port_of_lestria_desc: "What is the point of building a city on a coast if not to make trade with the world at large? Lestria is by no means a small city compared to some of its compatriots around the world, but it could always be larger. It could always exert more influence on the seas, attract more merchants, have more traders flock in its streets - by making the expansion of Lestria a priority above most of everything else, we signal to the world that not only are we powerful as we are now, but that we will only grow in power as time goes on."
 carn_the_blue_flower: "The Blue Flower"
 carn_the_blue_flower_desc: "Within the Aegmerist faith, the Blue Flower, existing as a counterpart to Aegmer, represents the good that exists in the world - it is a representation of the lawful order of things. That even in chaos, stability exists, and that good will inevitably triumph over all evil. Our citizens, in their dark times, look to the Blue Flower for guidance, praying, hoping, believing that things will eventually turn out good - and as they do, for after every rain comes sunshine, so grows the influence of the Blue Flower. It gives people hope, an emotion that rarely if ever trumps any other."
 carn_divine_touch: "Divine touch"
 carn_divine_touch_desc: "The Caeron is divinely chosen by Aegmer to rule”, says the Caeron. Whether you beleive them or not it is true that being in the presence of any monarch - but  maybe especially the Caeron - brings with it a certain sense of intimidation and power, exuded only and uniquely by kings. If nothing else, it is divine propaganda, bolstering the power of the Caeron above that of normal monarchs to a certain extent, something which can certainly be useful when it comes to matters of enforcing your will on the people."

 A39_tyrian_minds: "Týrian Minds"
 A39_tyrian_minds_desc: "The Swampfolk were fathered and brought up by our great scholars and philosophers, they have adopted many of our customs and been influenced by much of our culture especially in the arts of smithing and carving. We are their teachers, our ingenuity is copied by the Miremen and the other cultures. Our great minds shall continue to work on the next assignments, the student shall not overcome the teacher this time, not a Týrian one."
 A39_in_the_shadow_of_giants: "In the Shadow of Giants"
 A39_in_the_shadow_of_giants_desc: "Our city-states have been ceremoniously at war with each other as far back as our oldest scrolls. Our warriors  are accustomed to wars and so are their sons, brought up to fight for their cities. If any wretched foreign invader dares to step on our soil, our numbers will swell, united as one! When we fight each other, our true strength does not show. When they march upon us, it will."
 A39_skilled_in_the_arts: "Skilled in the Arts"
 A39_skilled_in_the_arts_desc: "Our ancestors were prideful of their artworks and creations. Even today, we export our goods across the seas to those who can afford to pay the price. Our artisans have improved their techniques for hundreds of years, a little push with the aid of our coffers can lead to our crafts to flourish once again."
 A39_terror_upon_the_sivan: "Terror upon the Sivan"
 A39_terror_upon_the_sivan_desc: "Situated in the crossroads of the Sivan, our peoples have become accustomed to all things at sea. Our fleets match those of the great seafaring nations across the wide waters as prove to be formidable opponents to any foe we may face. Our excellency at sea has allowed some of our destitute or those seaking adventure to take to the waves and make a fortune out of plundering our competitors."
 A39_three_cities: "The Three Cities"
 A39_three_cities_desc: "Our three main cities will not be able to fight with sword and spear alone. Flexible diplomacy is key to any nation, new or old. It is our duty to train our diplomats so that they may sway our allies and get their continued support. Allies are invaluable and as such our silver-tounged diplomats will become our tools in gaining such alliances."
 A39_devoted_to_sakrelith: "Devoted to Sakrelith"
 A39_devoted_to_sakrelith_desc: "Our faith has always been a pillar of our civilization, if our subjects do not follow our religion how can we expect them to follow us? It is imperative that we make great efforts in converting our new vassals and citizens. With man alone its impossible, but with Sakrelith its possible."

It is this strong egalititarian tradition that binds our people, our spirit and our land together"
 B11_hybrid_culture: "Hybrid Culture"
 B11_hybrid_culture_desc: "Hybridization has been a slow, centuries' long project, as our nation has painstakingly sought to undo the cataclysmic result of our initial arrival in Vastallos. However, through this process we have gained a far greater understanding towards our fellow man, an understanding that has been ingrained into the very character of our state"
 B11_dyvrechsal_education: "Dyvrechsal Education"
 B11_dyvrechsal_education_desc: "It is no secret that our republic has a confusing relationship with the Noxist Dyvrechsal. In some instances, the church is weak and uninvolved. In others, we can see it wield absolutely uncontested power. One such area would be the education of our populace. Luckly, the Dyvrechsal has never taken this power lightly, and whilst some iterations of the Noxist church seek to suppress knowledge ours has always sought to uplift and understand"
 B11_never_another_blackstone: "Never Another Blackstone"
 B11_never_another_blackstone_desc: "All citizens have heard the story. It was the Siege of Blackstone that ended the Golden Age of Donsktopt and ever since our nation has been in decline. Our army, fractured and abandoned as it is, needs to be one that is mobile and quick to outflank enemies.

 B11_soldiers_of_the_deur_rhyonne_desc: "In ancient times, before the eventual adoption of the Knossian Mercenaries as the primary army of Donsktopt, the Republic could call upon the Deur Rhyónne, an elite professional fighting force of limited numbers that would scream down the mountains peaks and rip out the throats of those who would dare threaten the peace and stability of our fair state. Though diminished in stature and standing, they continue to fuel our republic ever onwards"
 B11_from_the_mountain_loins: "From the Mountain Loins"
 B11_from_the_mountain_loins_desc: "Utop the highest point in Vastallos, Donsktopt has always been able to project power and influence down on the forests and jungles of the subcontinent.

A nation of craftsmen, we have never been geared towards war, rather it has been the prerogative of our nation to use our wealth and innovativeness to tie our sphere of influence together"
 B11_children_of_afton: "Children of Afton"
 B11_children_of_afton_desc: "Whereas the plebians have always held us accountable through our republic, it is the Vudynn that holds us accountable through our faith. The balance between church and state has always been a hard one to maintain, however it is through the maintenance of this balance that our state has managed to obtain peace and prosperity. Naturally, this means that though we pride ourselves as more religiously tolerant that our peers, the country can never be allowed to fall into debauchery"
