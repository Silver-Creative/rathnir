 A00_council_of_elders:0 "Council of Elders"
 A00_council_of_elders_desc:0 "When we began to spread our wings over Rathnir, it became obvious that our old Jagdasian provincial system would fail. Instead, we have devised a system in which the eldest- and thus wisest- member of each town will act as a courier between us and our far-flung provinces. Their pride lets us pay them less, if nothing else."
 A00_bandit_captain_recruitment:0 "Bandit Captain Recruitment"
 A00_bandit_captain_recruitment_desc:0 "Bandits plagued us in our early days in Rathnir. Most nations developed some sort of militia to fend them off, but where they saw an enemy we saw an opportunity. By integrating bandit captains into our chain of command, we pacify our enemies and turn them into our allies. So what if it makes the people uneasy?"
 A00_establish_the_urdussad:0 "Establish the Urdussad"
 A00_establish_the_urdussad_desc:0 "Yimmu-Audal has always known religious freedom, even in during the occupation.

 A00_lily_fleet:0 "Lily Fleet"

 A00_horse_reacquisition:0 "Horse Reacquisition"
 A00_horse_reacquisition_desc:0 "Horses are an invaluable resource. Messengers, beasts of burden, cavalry, their uses are everywhere and obvious. Let us nationalize them all, so as to ensure we and we alone decide where they are used."
 A00_the_glory_of_urnu-arrak:0 "The Glory of Urnu-Arrak"
 A00_the_glory_of_urnu-arrak_desc:0 "There is no city greater than Urnu-Arrak. The Silver Citadel lies tarnished, Lileanen flooded, Hapatmitas a ghost town, Dorasterrock's markets bare, and Aezenfjord more a nature reserve than a settlement. Urnu, however, stands as splendid as ever. Let us allocate more of our workforce to make it even more grand."
 A00_cutting_tongue:0 "Cutting Tongue"
 A00_cutting_tongue_desc:0 "All rulers fear an Audalad diplomat, for there are none whose tongues are quicker or more cutting. For every lash of their tongue, it is said that ten thousand wounds are placed upon your reputation."

 A07_legacy_of_the_witch-hunts_desc:0 "While we no long hunt witches and other evil sorcerers, all magic practitioners in our land know that the law remains in effect. If nothing else, it puts the people at ease."
 A07_phagosian_ferries:0 "Phagosian Ferries"
 A07_phagosian_ferries_desc:0 "Coltmaere's islands are small, numerous, and far flung. To this effect, Coltmaeran boats are fast and made for efficient transport. If only this made them better in battle..."
 A07_hjuzairar:0 "Hjuzairar"
 A07_hjuzairar_desc:0 "Due to the isolated nature of Coltmaere's islands, foreign nobles tend to build estates here. We allow them to, of course, for a hefty price."
 A07_iceshapers:0 "Iceshapers"
 A07_iceshapers_desc:0 "Keshnev's ice shapers are strange indeed. They turn summer heat into winter snow, and claim to see the future in the ice... Despite our nominal ban on witchcraft, it may be wise to sanction their divination practices."

 N00_restore_the_cardinal_desc:0 "After the Ascension came the decentralization of the Soleannen faith.
