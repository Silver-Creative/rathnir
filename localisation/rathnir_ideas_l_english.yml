 A00_ideas_bonus: "Audalad Ambition"
 A00_council_of_elders: "Council of Elders"
 A00_council_of_elders_desc: "When we began to spread our wings over Rathnir, it became obvious that our old Jagdasian provincial system would fail. Instead, we have devised a system in which the eldest- and thus wisest- member of each town will act as a courier between us and our far-flung provinces. Their pride lets us pay them less, if nothing else."
 A00_bandit_captain_recruitment: "Bandit Captain Recruitment"
 A00_bandit_captain_recruitment_desc: "Bandits plagued us in our early days in Rathnir. Most nations developed some sort of militia to fend them off, but where they saw an enemy we saw an opportunity. By integrating bandit captains into our chain of command, we pacify our enemies and turn them into our allies. So what if it makes the people uneasy?"
 A00_establish_the_urdussad: "Establish the Urdussad"
 A00_establish_the_urdussad_desc: "Yimmu-Audal has always known religious freedom, even in during the occupation. However, as religions grow more complex and centralized, we have decided to create a council of loyal priests in our realm to lead their flocks within Yimmu-Audal, as to reduce foreign influence."
 A00_lily_fleet: "Lily Fleet"
 A00_lily_fleet_desc: "Despite our maritime nature in Jagdas, we had all but abandoned naval affairs once we began our more continental empire here on Rathnir. With the capture of the Lily Fleet from the Escharians, though, a new zeal for naval dominance has found us."
 A00_horse_reacquisition: "Horse Reacquisition"
 A00_horse_reacquisition_desc: "Horses are an invaluable resource. Messengers, beasts of burden, cavalry, their uses are everywhere and obvious. Let us nationalize them all, so as to ensure we and we alone decide where they are used."
 A00_the_glory_of_urnu-arrak: "The Glory of Urnu-Arrak"
 A00_the_glory_of_urnu-arrak_desc: "There is no city greater than Urnu-Arrak. The Silver Citadel lies tarnished, Lileanen flooded, Hapatmitas a ghost town, Dorasterrock's markets bare, and Aezenfjord more a nature reserve than a settlement. Urnu, however, stands as splendid as ever. Let us allocate more of our workforce to make it even more grand."
 A00_cutting_tongue: "Cutting Tongue"
 A00_cutting_tongue_desc: "All rulers fear an Audalad diplomat, for there are none whose tongues are quicker or more cutting. For every lash of their tongue, it is said that ten thousand wounds are placed upon your reputation."

 A01_trading_in_the_ombra_gulf_desc: "Ayesinco is situated on a peninsula of the same name, which conveniently juts out into the heart of the trade-rich Ombra Gulf. Many a wise merchant have been made rich off of its trade, and it is high time for the state to do the same."
 A01_desert_warfare: "Desert Warfare"
 A01_desert_warfare_desc: "Theiónikos is, for better or worse, primarily in the desert. This does mean, however, that our troops are much more adept at surviving the often-harsh sun. Why fight if we can instead watch our enemies simply lose themselves to the sand?"
 A01_host_the_swordgames: "Host the Swordgames"
 A01_host_the_swordgames_desc: "When the Red Cult was still rampant in our lands, they held bloodsports as part of their human sacrifices. While we have since banned the more sacrificial elements of the games, we now have a class of semi-professional gladiators. Perhaps we should integrate what remains of these games, so that we have more war-ready men to pull from?"
 A01_granary_of_the_phagosian: "Granary of the Phagosian"
 A01_granary_of_the_phagosian_desc: "We may be a desert, but the Gebel river's banks are perhaps the most productive on the Phagosean. Let us exploit this niche, export grain on the very river it is grown on."
 A01_riders_across_the_dunes: "Riders across the Dunes"
 A01_riders_across_the_dunes_desc: "The desert is our home, and has been since the Lausarii tribesmen settled here centuries ago. Woe to anyone who tries to fight us here, for we know our home, and our home is more than happy to aid in its defense."
 A01_bulwark_against_the_sandstorms: "Bulwark against the Sandstorms"
 A01_bulwark_against_the_sandstorms_desc: "All of our buildings have to be constructed in a way that prevents them from being eroded away by sandstorms. Luckily, the same techniques also happen to make our forts more resistant to attack."

 A03_for_monath_desc: "While Monáth was subsumed into the ranks of the Theiosist angels long ago, many Astyllean islanders still revere Monáth alone. Our priests embrace this, for Monáth is our patron and eternal defender from wrath both divine and infernal."
 A03_noblesse_oblige: "Noblesse Oblige"
 A03_noblesse_oblige_desc: "No Táloran nobleman would be caught dead being impolite or unwelcoming. Indeed, nobles who fail to meet the high standards of conduct are treated as a social anathema."
 A03_supreme_engineers: "Supreme Engineers"
 A03_supreme_engineers_desc: "There are no greater engineers than the engineers of Tálor! Or, at least, that's what the Tálorans would say. Given the Pillars of Tarad-Elarae and the many great palaces dotting the Astyllean coastline, few attempt to challenge them."
 A03_masters_of_the_astyllean: "Masters of the Astyllean"
 A03_masters_of_the_astyllean_desc: "From the very foundation of our kingdom after the fall of Hraam, Tálor has held undisputed control of the Astyllean. Even when Tálor was under Yimmu-Audal's rule, wise ships knew to fly Táloran colors when passing our shores."
 A03_new_ordinances: "New Ordinances"
 A03_new_ordinances_desc: "In 1666 ASC King Antares Rochelle, frustrated with disorganized and inefficient fishing methods, began enforcing the Cod Laws. These delineated strict regulations for when, where, and how fish could be caught, stored, and sold."
 A03_new_ordinators: "...and New Ordinators"
 A03_new_ordinators_desc: "Emboldened by the success of his Cod Laws, Antares used the profits gained through new taxes to hire a veritable army of clerks to keep track of every purchase, vastly simplifying the headaches of trade."
 A03_aurdiann_mead: "Aurdíann Mead"
 A03_aurdiann_mead_desc: "The Aurdíann family has a long history in Vortakor. Commonly believed to have founded the city soon after the end of the Hraamic empire, the Aurdíanns are renowned for their mead. By using the same equipment for centuries the casks of Vortakor produce a truly irreplicable flavor, developed over generations of careful brewers. From Athazolant to Serafini, no cellar is complete without a bottle."

 A07_a_yellow_memory: "A Yellow Memory"
 A07_a_yellow_memory_desc: "Despite our estrangement, the people of Coltmaere are closely related to the Bardonians and Ryzani. Perhaps we could learn a thing or two from their warrior spirit..."

 A07_phagosian_ferries: "Phagosian Ferries"
 A07_phagosian_ferries_desc: "Coltmaere's islands are small, numerous, and far flung. To this effect, Coltmaeran boats are fast and made for efficient transport. If only this made them better in battle..."
 A07_hjuzairar: "Hjuzairar"

 A07_iceshapers: "Iceshapers"
 A07_iceshapers_desc: "Keshnev's ice shapers are strange indeed. They turn summer heat into winter snow, and claim to see the future in the ice... Despite our nominal ban on witchcraft, it may be wise to sanction their divination practices."

 A21_a_brand_new_home_desc: "For ages, the kin and friends of the Seraan and the faithful of Asitir have endured suffering and punishment from all the peoples in Rathnir. No more! Lirgalyn of all ages, genders, and origins flock towards the City Guard, vowing to protect the Lunar City-State until their last breath. Never shall Lirgal fall again - neither through conquest nor through sorrowful abandonment. We will see to it."
 A21_masters_of_arcana: "Masters of Arcana"
 A21_masters_of_arcana_desc: "Whence does knowledge come? May it be the Light that shines upon all of the world? May it be the inner inclinations to understanding? Be it Deity or Man? That is a question to be answered by the greatest of philosophers and theologians - thankfully, Lirgal has plenty of both."
 A21_land_beloved_by_all: "A Land Beloved By All"
 A21_land_beloved_by_all_desc: "It is not only Lirgalyn who flock to the protection of the Lunar City-State. From all corner of the words, Mercernaries raise their weapons high in a bid to protect the City-State from certain peril. The favour of all fighters of the world fall upon Lirgal."
 A21_seraani_diplomacy: "Seraani Diplomacy"
 A21_seraani_diplomacy_desc: "The Seraan have always been known for their diplomatic ability and prowess. Before the times of the Almadorian conquest, Olarã ruled not through fear, but through love. When walking through the city-scapes of Lirgal and being showered of niceties by eager Lirgalyn diplomats, how could one not fall in love again?"
 A21_busy_bee_like: "Busy-bee-like Dispositions"
 A21_busy_bee_like_desc: "None can accuse the Lirgalyn of slacking. Though certain structures may go unfinished and projects be put on hold indefinitely, the overall expansion and development of Lirgal never ceases, never stops - with Lirgalyn hands, construction is done in a fraction of second, and one cannot help but be amazed at their disposition. Will Lirgal ever stop growing?"
 A21_benevolent_tyrants: "Benevolent Tyrants"
 A21_benevolent_tyrants_desc: "The fist of Lirgal, even if made of steel, always wears the softest of velvet gloves. No realm subservient to Lirgal has any right to decry their position, for they know they could very much be in a worse state under any other realm. To be under the hand of Lirgal is better than to be crushed by the fist of any other country."
 A21_lirgal_stands: "Lirgal Stands"
 A21_lirgal_stands_desc: "The ages have hardened Lirgal. What was once a friendly and naive city-state has turned into an austere but gentle country. War has been studied, and war has been fought - Lirgal stood. The Lirgalyn population is ever so hardened, and Lirgal shan't ever see ruin again."

 #A22 and A94 - Carn/Lestria
 carn_ideas: "Carnian ideas"
 carn_ideas_start: "Carnian Traditions"
 carn_ideas_bonus: "Carnian Ambition"
 carn_lestrian_red: "Lestrian Red"
 carn_lestrian_red_desc: "Many nations around the world lay claim to their own drinks and cuisine, but even among red wines Lestrian red is said to be unique. Brewed and fermented from the grapes that naturally dot the Carnian and Reyllean plains, it is a dark, hardy wine suited for the strongest of warriors - yet, simultaneously, it is slightly sweet, and bitter but not too bitter, falling into that perfect sweetspot that so many other wines and winemakers around the world wish they had achieved."
 carn_the_old_cults: "The Old Cults"
 carn_the_old_cults_desc: "No one exactly knows where the traditions, ideas and values that build the foundation of Aegmerism come from - and if they do, it’s likely that they’re atleast partly lying. Though the religion itself is not too old in comparison with some of its counterparts along the continent, certain signs point to it being much older than we all can definitively prove. Within Carn this more often than not leads to certain strife regarding canonicity and historical rulers, but outside it? Well, it certainly gives a certain sense of prestige and legitimacy, legitimacy that has a minor  but noticeable effect on the heretics around Carn."
 carn_lantine_legacy: "Lantine Legacy"
 carn_lantine_legacy_desc: "Within the history scrolls, Lant - these days more often known as saint Allantus - is identified as the first ruler of the Caeronate of Carn, several centuries in the past. Being the first ruler, his ideas and values hold a certain sway over the more modern Caerons, who look back to him and his immediate successors with optimism, hope, and as signs of better times. Or, when times are good, examples that can be pointed to in order to drive home the point that those good old times never really faded."
 carn_the_erneraevis: "The Erneraevis"
 carn_the_erneraevis_desc: "The Erneraevis - the elite core unit of the Carnian army - is like no other. Trained from birth to be loyal servants of the Caeron serving him faithfully until death, they do not know the word dishonor and would gladly take their own lives if it meant the Caeron lived, something that can’t be said for most normal soldiers. Within the army they strike fear on the battlefield, and at home they can often be seen in their secondary role as protectors of the Caeron himself, walking alongside him on the streets as his personal guards at all times."
 carn_port_of_lestria: "Port of Lestria"
 carn_port_of_lestria_desc: "What is the point of building a city on a coast if not to make trade with the world at large? Lestria is by no means a small city compared to some of its compatriots around the world, but it could always be larger. It could always exert more influence on the seas, attract more merchants, have more traders flock in its streets - by making the expansion of Lestria a priority above most of everything else, we signal to the world that not only are we powerful as we are now, but that we will only grow in power as time goes on."
 carn_the_blue_flower: "The Blue Flower"
 carn_the_blue_flower_desc: "Within the Aegmerist faith, the Blue Flower, existing as a counterpart to Aegmer, represents the good that exists in the world - it is a representation of the lawful order of things. That even in chaos, stability exists, and that good will inevitably triumph over all evil. Our citizens, in their dark times, look to the Blue Flower for guidance, praying, hoping, believing that things will eventually turn out good - and as they do, for after every rain comes sunshine, so grows the influence of the Blue Flower. It gives people hope, an emotion that rarely if ever trumps any other."
 carn_divine_touch: "Divine Touch"
 carn_divine_touch_desc: "\"The Caeron is divinely chosen by Aegmer to rule”, says the Caeron. Whether you beleive them or not it is true that being in the presence of any monarch - but  maybe especially the Caeron - brings with it a certain sense of intimidation and power, exuded only and uniquely by kings. If nothing else, it is divine propaganda, bolstering the power of the Caeron above that of normal monarchs to a certain extent, something which can certainly be useful when it comes to matters of enforcing your will on the people."

 lt_auraion_cavalry_desc: "The drylands around the gulf of Auraion have given rise to a very particular breed of horse: The Auraion Lightfoot. While not well-suited to hard labor and bearing a very flighty temperment, they are perhaps the fastest horses in the known world. While using exclusively Auraion Lightfoots may not aid our charges, their speed will allow us to vastly outmaneuver our enemies."

The new stock from these ranches are healthier than their wild cousins. The blur associated with a charging regiment of Lausarii cavalry has given rise to a new nickname: 'The Violet Breeze'."
 A50_sea_second_home: "The Sea, Our Second Home"
 A50_sea_second_home_desc: "There is nothing like the thrill of the hunt. While hunting on land has become unsustainable, the hunt on the sea has only begun. Perhaps those glory days of maritime raiding were more than just myth?"
 A50_more_than_thrift: "More than Thrift"
 A50_more_than_thrift_desc: "Brutal efficiency. Nothing less is acceptable for governors trained in the Selak Acadamy. Every coin of tax is collected, every bit of land survayed, every account scrutinized. Some may call it cruelty, of course, but they simply don't have thrift."
 A50_hand_of_solaris: "The Hand of Solaris"
 A50_hand_of_solaris_desc: "The Kiasta is one of five bodies of water that flow into the Auraion. The Kemitha, Elisin, and Vassos also flow into the sea. In recent years, the Auraion Gulf and its tributaries have been stylized by our mapmakers as ann outstretched hand, with the Kiasta as its pinky and the northern Ionesi inlet as its thumb. Regardless of artistic stylizations, the calm waters- perfect for trade and the production of ships- does, at times, make it feel as if we were living in Solaris's own palm."
 A50_death_defied: "Death Defied"
 A50_death_defied_desc: "We have lived! The heretics and heathenous barbarians have been turned back! Death comes still, but not for us! Not this day!"
 A50_kjastii_reborn: "The Kjastii Reborn"
 A50_kjastii_reborn_desc: "In retrospect, we regret razing the city of Kjásthejm. If Hákon hadn't been captured and enslaved, he would have never able to found his heathenous state. He would have never dismantled countless tribes in favor of his Theios. Our kin would have never been seduced into the barberous culture of the Audalads. The past, however, is the past. While we cannot undo the damage he has done to our culture, we can heal from it. As apostates return from their sin and the Theióniki realize the emptiness of their culture, let us welcome them home as long-lost kin. The Kjastii may have vanished in fire and an orange flood, but under our care they will return."

 B09_prophecy_desc: "The peoples of Vastallos must be made aware of Dandelism's guidance and it's influence on our way of life and military practice now that Vastallos has been conquered. The Order will sponsor these Missionaries in their quest to show them the path."
 B09_orders: "The Orders"

 B11_the_ancient_republic_desc: "Donskopt is renown across Rathnir as one of the oldest known republics; a fact our people bare proudly and boast of eagerly. Even in our decline, the systems of our elder republic have proven inspiration to both soldiers and statesmen alike. It is this strong egalititarian tradition that binds our people, our spirit and our land together"
 B11_hybrid_culture: "Hybrid Culture"
 B11_hybrid_culture_desc: "Hybridization has been a slow, centuries' long project, as our nation has painstakingly sought to undo the cataclysmic result of our initial arrival in Vastallos. However, through this process we have gained a far greater understanding towards our fellow man, an understanding that has been ingrained into the very character of our state"
 B11_dyvrechsal_education: "Dyvrechsal Education"
 B11_dyvrechsal_education_desc: "It is no secret that our republic has a confusing relationship with the Noxist Dyvrechsal. In some instances, the church is weak and uninvolved. In others, we can see it wield absolutely uncontested power. One such area would be the education of our populace. Luckly, the Dyvrechsal has never taken this power lightly, and whilst some iterations of the Noxist church seek to suppress knowledge ours has always sought to uplift and understand"
 B11_never_another_blackstone: "Never Another Blackstone"
 B11_never_another_blackstone_desc: "All citizens have heard the story. It was the Siege of Blackstone that ended the Golden Age of Donsktopt and ever since our nation has been in decline. Our army, fractured and abandoned as it is, needs to be one that is mobile and quick to outflank enemies. The key to that, are quick, resourceful generals that won't just sit idly in a fortress-turned-tomb"
 B11_soldiers_of_the_deur_rhyonne: "Soldiers of the Deur Rhyónne"
 B11_soldiers_of_the_deur_rhyonne_desc: "In ancient times, before the eventual adoption of the Knossian Mercenaries as the primary army of Donsktopt, the Republic could call upon the Deur Rhyónne, an elite professional fighting force of limited numbers that would scream down the mountains peaks and rip out the throats of those who would dare threaten the peace and stability of our fair state. Though diminished in stature and standing, they continue to fuel our republic ever onwards"
 B11_from_the_mountain_loins: "From the Mountain Loins"
 B11_from_the_mountain_loins_desc: "Utop the highest point in Vastallos, Donsktopt has always been able to project power and influence down on the forests and jungles of the subcontinent. This has come from our people's unique ingenious view of the world and focus on internal growth. A nation of craftsmen, we have never been geared towards war, rather it has been the prerogative of our nation to use our wealth and innovativeness to tie our sphere of influence together"
 B11_children_of_afton: "Children of Afton"
 B11_children_of_afton_desc: "Whereas the plebians have always held us accountable through our republic, it is the Vudynn that holds us accountable through our faith. The balance between church and state has always been a hard one to maintain, however it is through the maintenance of this balance that our state has managed to obtain peace and prosperity. Naturally, this means that though we pride ourselves as more religiously tolerant that our peers, the country can never be allowed to fall into debauchery"

 N00_restore_the_cardinal: "Restore the Cardinal"
 N00_restore_the_cardinal_desc: "After the Ascension came the decentralization of the Soleannen faith. The question "who will control the Cardinal?" has permeated in the heads of every Soleannen nation as they fought like vultures over a corpse. It's time to return to the times in which the Soleannen faith is united under one nation, emperor, and cardinal."
