 A00_council_of_elders: "Council of Elders"
 A00_council_of_elders_desc: "When we began to spread our wings over Rathnir, it became obvious that our old Jagdasian provincial system would fail. Instead, we have devised a system in which the eldest- and thus wisest- member of each town will act as a courier between us and our far-flung provinces. Their pride lets us pay them less, if nothing else."
 A00_bandit_captain_recruitment: "Bandit Captain Recruitment"
 A00_bandit_captain_recruitment_desc: "Bandits plagued us in our early days in Rathnir. Most nations developed some sort of militia to fend them off, but where they saw an enemy we saw an opportunity. By integrating bandit captains into our chain of command, we pacify our enemies and turn them into our allies. So what if it makes the people uneasy?"
 A00_establish_the_urdussad: "Establish the Urdussad"
 A00_establish_the_urdussad_desc: "Yimmu-Audal has always known religious freedom, even in during the occupation.

 A00_lily_fleet: "Lily Fleet"

 A00_horse_reacquisition_desc: "Horses are an invaluable resource. Messengers, beasts of burden, cavalry, their uses are everywhere and obvious. Let us nationalize them all, so as to ensure we and we alone decide where they are used."
 A00_the_glory_of_urnu-arrak: "The Glory of Urnu-Arrak"
 A00_the_glory_of_urnu-arrak_desc: "There is no city greater than Urnu-Arrak. The Silver Citadel lies tarnished, Lileanen flooded, Hapatmitas a ghost town, Dorasterrock's markets bare, and Aezenfjord more a nature reserve than a settlement. Urnu, however, stands as splendid as ever. Let us allocate more of our workforce to make it even more grand."
 A00_cutting_tongue: "Cutting Tongue"

 A01_desert_warfare_desc: "Theiónikos is, for better or worse, primarily in the desert. This does mean, however, that our troops are much more adept at surviving the often-harsh sun. Why fight if we can instead watch our enemies simply lose themselves to the sand?"
 A01_host_the_swordgames: "Host the Swordgames"
 A01_host_the_swordgames_desc: "When the Red Cult was still rampant in our lands, they held bloodsports as part of their human sacrifices. While we have since banned the more sacrificial elements of the games, we now have a class of semi-professional gladiators. Perhaps we should integrate what remains of these games, so that we have more war-ready men to pull from?"
 A01_granary_of_the_phagosian: "Granary of the Phagosian"
 A01_granary_of_the_phagosian_desc: "We may be a desert, but the Gebel river's banks are perhaps the most productive on the Phagosean. Let us exploit this niche, export grain on the very river it is grown on."

 A01_riders_across_the_dunes_desc: "The desert is our home, and has been since the Lausarii tribesmen settled here centuries ago. Woe to anyone who tries to fight us here, for we know our home, and our home is more than happy to aid in its defense."
