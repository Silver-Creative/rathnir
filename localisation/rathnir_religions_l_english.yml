   HOLY_SITE_244_DESC: "Atop the tallest of Azethvir's many hills stands the proud §YSanctum of the Judge§!, the holiest site of Sakrelith's faithful. Constructed under Temion, the legendary founder of Sironia, this temple has since bore witness to countless miracles, the last three of which elevated the great Archon, Rithaur IV, to the status of Prophet-Descendant."
   HOLY_SITE_257_DESC: "Deep within the winding tunnels and caverns of Lapidovir lays the imposing §YSanctum of the Smith§!, the hall of Iniron's followers. Inlaid into a wide light-caressed cavern deep below the earth, it is believed that this temple once served as a great fortress of the goblin Underkingdom before it was sacked and seized by the Sagaviri of Old, in a great charge led by none other than Iniron, one of Sakrelith's messengers, who laboured for years on end to cleanse the Underdark below Aldovir of the Darkness' hold."
   HOLY_SITE_215_DESC: "Gently nestled within the great old groves of Raêl sits the welcoming §YSanctum of the Mother§!, a delicate and elegant shrine erected in name of Asala. It is said that in ancient times, before even the rise of Old Sagavir, the lands of Raêl were not the rolling green hills and gentle meadows of wheat and barley one can see today; they were swamplands, marshes and thick bogs where all manner of hags, drowned and other beasts hunted the poor folk, and only through Asala's gentle fire were they purged and the land made anew."
   HOLY_SITE_285_DESC: "Prominently beyond the uneven red and black lines of Athazolant's homes rises the austere §YSanctum of the Scholar§!, a true monument to Ataron's teachings. Though lost many centuries ago to heathen invaders from Western Sparwood and Tàlor, this great temple continues, in a way, to honor the Scholar's life and legacy: scholars and scribes flood into the sanctum day by day, streaming steadily into endless halls and towers and rooms where naught but books and tomes and grimoires can be found."
   HOLY_SITE_325_DESC: "Though long departed from their native homeland and firmly disconnected from the schemes and plots of Aldovir, the Asturcians of Vastallos remain, as they forever have been, Sagaviri and Sakrelist. Unlike their kin beyond the Umbra Gulf, however, they have since come to disregard the tradition of erecting temples to singular figures or prophets, and have opted to coalesce them all into unified places of worship. And of these, none stand proudest and tallest than the §YGrand Temple of the North§!."
   HOLY_SITE_279_DESC: "Zealously inspired in Temion's image, countless priests have donned the robes of missionaries, the Asala, over the centuries and departed their homes in Aldovir to spread Sakrelith's word wide and far. Of all these missions, few found greater success than those who moored in Lumaire, the Jewel of the South. Despite similar attempts by the Soleannen of Nieden have been made, it would appear that the good folk of Lumaire find greater warmth in Sakrelith's fire than in Solaris' false flames, so much so that a temple in the image of Asturcia's has since been erected: the §YGrand Temple of the South§!"
   HOLY_SITE_673_DESC: "Zealously inspired in Temion's image, countless priests have donned the robes of missionaries, the Asala, over the centuries and departed their homes in Aldovir to spread Sakrelith's word wide and far. Of all neighbouring civilizations, few would disagree that those of Western Sparwood were they who dealt the most damage to Sagavir of Old; yet, surprisingly, even they have taken to Sakrelith's word like... moths to a flame. All over the eastern shores of the Astyllean, tabernacles and church have been erected, yet none stand tallest than the §YGrand Temple of the East§! in Serafini!"
