 flavor_carn.1.t: "The Ilivian question"
 flavor_carn.1.d: "Not too long ago, our former overlords - the Reylleans - conquered the Sironian town of Ilivian, sitting on the coast of the Gulf of Ilivian; it is a relatively small town, yet the Sironians and especially the Sironian government still see it as an open wound on the map, a wound that they would like to mend by any means necessary. While negotiations between Reyllea and the Sironians were never more than a suggestion we now, as the proprietors of the town, have been contacted by a Sironian diplomatic party in Lestria with the goal of starting discussions on the topic - and, they hope, fix the mistakes of the Reyllean kings. How do we respond?"
 flavor_carn.1.a: "We're better than the Reylleans - Let's give it back to the Sironians"
 flavor_carn.1.b: "What happened in Ilivian was tragic - We need to pay the debt the Reylleans accrued."
 flavor_carn.1.c: "We conquered it rightfully from the Reylleans, we must demand compensation for the town."
 flavor_carn.1.f: "How dare! It's our land, if they want it back they should come and take it from us!"
 flavor_carn.2.t: "Negotiations concluded"
 flavor_carn.2.d: "The sironians - wise in their negotiations - have accepted our generous offer for the city of Ilivian, and the city is now theirs once again. Though we may have missed out on a valuable port-city, surely good relations with the Sironians are a greater benefit to us than the benefits that Ilivian could have granted us in the long term."
 flavor_carn.2.a: "Then so it shall be!"
