#ilivian question pt 1
 flavor_carn.1.t: "The Ilivian question"
 flavor_carn.1.d: "Not too long ago, our former overlords - the Reylleans - conquered the Sironian town of Ilivian, sitting on the coast of the Gulf of Ilivian; it is a relatively small town, yet the Sironians and especially the Sironian government still see it as an open wound on the map, a wound that they would like to mend by any means necessary. While negotiations between Reyllea and the Sironians were never more than a suggestion we now, as the proprietors of the town, have been contacted by a Sironian diplomatic party in Lestria with the goal of starting discussions on the topic - and, they hope, fix the mistakes of the Reyllean kings. How do we respond?"
 flavor_carn.1.a: "We're better than the Reylleans - Let's give it back to the Sironians"
 flavor_carn.1.b: "What happened in Ilivian was tragic - We need to pay the debt the Reylleans accrued."
 flavor_carn.1.c: "We conquered it rightfully from the Reylleans, we must demand compensation for the town."
 flavor_carn.1.f: "How dare! It's our land, if they want it back they should come and take it from us!"

#ilivian question pt 2
 flavor_carn.2.t: "Negotiations concluded"
 flavor_carn.2.d: "The sironians - wise in their negotiations - have accepted our generous offer for the city of Ilivian, and the city is now theirs once again. Though we may have missed out on a valuable port-city, surely good relations with the Sironians are a greater benefit to us than the benefits that Ilivian could have granted us in the long term."
 flavor_carn.2.a: "Then so it shall be!"

#the black library
 flavor_carn.3.t: "The Black Library"
 flavor_carn.3.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is sitting at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throne in the Lestrian imperial palace. It's been a calm day - something that's growing more and more unusual these days. Suddenly, a man arrives at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet. He refers to himself as Daria, a local perhaps judging by the name, and he has a request. Ambition shines in his eyes as he speaks; he wants to build a great library in the province of Costaigne, a days walk to the north, a center of learning and perhaps theology. All he's requesting is a bit of money, and free reign on the land to hire builders and architects. There is potential in  him. But, at the same time, can an unknown man like this really be trusted with the project?"
 flavor_carn.3.a: "Deny his request. Who is this man, daring to come to the court asking for money?"
 flavor_carn.3.b: "Accept his request, and give him the money he wants to start construction."
 flavor_carn.3.c: "Surely you know more about building libraries than your citizens?"

#grand gatherings
 flavor_carn.4.t: "The grand gathering"
 flavor_carn.4.d: "Our previous ruler - may they find peace in what comes next - has passed. Rumours are still coming in, and noone is exactly sure how it happened; some say they passed in their sleep, peacefully. Others say it was an assassination, maybe even divine intervention, but no matter the case the nation needs a leader - turning to tradition, the regency council left in our previous rulers wake ends up organizing a grand gathering, where all the nobles of Carn and spectators from lands afar gather to vote on, and hopefully inaugurate, the new Caeron of Carn. The only question is, who is it going to be..."
 flavor_carn.4.a: "We want an Elernel!"
 flavor_carn.4.b: "Let's give someone else a shot for once."
 flavor_carn.5.d: "Our previous ruler - may they find peace in what comes next - has passed. Rumours are still coming in, and noone is exactly sure how it happened; some say they passed in their sleep, peacefully. Others say it was an assassination, maybe even divine intervention, but no matter the case the nation needs a leader - turning to tradition, the regency council left in our previous rulers wake ends up organizing a grand gathering, where all the nobles of Carn and spectators from lands afar gather to vote on, and hopefully inaugurate, the new Caeron of Carn. The only question is, who is it going to be...\n\nThe people, ever hungry for noble and powerful leaders, still remember Kerplis. According to many he was the greatest Caeron in a century - and no Caeron since has been able to live up to what he managed to accomplish in his reign. It's seeming more and more like this grand gathering will be of vital importance to the future of the nation, in more ways than one..."

#the elernel family
 flavor_carn.6.t: "The Elernel family"
 flavor_carn.6.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been watching the progress on the black library for some time now. It’s progressing remarkably fast - a large, black tower has been erected on a hill in what was previously nothing but a tiny village, and soon people expect, it’ll grow into something much larger than even that. Right after the messenger carrying the status update on the black library leaves [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s court, someone unexpected enters the Lestrian palace. It’s Daria, and walking beside him is none other than the Caeron’s sole daughter.\n\nThey start speaking almost in unison, both clearly nervous about confronting [Root.Monarch.GetName] like this - as they talk, they explain that they met each other shortly after the building permit for the black library was first granted, and that they’ve been in love ever since. All he asks is the Caeron's blessing to take her hand in marriage; naturally, this would also make him [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s son-in-law, but..\n\nBefore the Caeron finishes [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] thought, Daria interrupts with another - much bolder - request. He wants to be adopted into the family, to be made into an Elernel, if not in blood atleast in spirit. The sheer boldness of this man, to not only stroll into the palace asking to marry the Caeron’s daughter, but to also ask to be made an Elernel in the process - if nothing else, the tenacity of him must be admired…"
 flavor_carn.6.a: "Grant his request"
 flavor_carn.6.b: "How dare he..? Guards, take him away!"

#all the small things
 flavor_carn.7.t: "All the small things"
 flavor_carn.7.d: "It's been a busy few months - for everyone. No matter the outcome the war took a heavy toll on the land and especially the people; farms still lay deserted, their former owners long-since buried, whether that be on the battlefield or in a cemetery. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has spent the last few days travelling the countryside, taking in the situation and keeping up the morale of their citizens. In a rare lull [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] veers off to the side of the dirt-paved road - and finds a beautiful, blooming patch of cornflowers. A sign of things to come, perhaps. "
 flavor_carn.7.a: "Send thanks to Aegmer with a quick prayer to the man in the porcelain mask."
 flavor_carn.7.b: "There's no time for this."

#hostile takeover
 flavor_carn.8.t: "Hostile takeover"
 flavor_carn.8.d: "It started as a normal day - then, suddenly, it was not. It all happened so quickly, surely this must have been planned months in advance; The ever-loyal Erneraevis are nowhere to be seen, something [Root.Monarch.GetName] hadn’t noticed until it was too late. Daria - that foul man the Caeron once thought to adopt as his own son - is now standing in the throne room, demanding the throne for himself, with a full regiment of your own soldiers backing him up. It doesn’t seem like there’s many options available…"
 flavor_carn.8.a: "Try to argue with him; after all, the Caeron’s will is Aegmer’s will"
 flavor_carn.8.b: "Concede. He’s won. Better to give up and spare your own life."
 flavor_carn.8.c: "Concede - on a condition. He needs to promise to preserve the grand gathering."

#against all odds
 flavor_carn.9.t: "Against all odds"
 flavor_carn.9.d: "The Caeron won - somehow, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] won. After a brief few minutes in argument, Daria concedes, and takes a step back, signalling for his soldiers to lay down their weapons aswell. “You’re right”, he says, “I made a mistake - misjudged you, my Caeron. Anyone can see that the will of Aegmer flows within you; i only wish that I had seen it myself sooner, so that things hadn’t had to come to this.” He promises to leave the court, and return to the black library - in any normal situation he'd have been exiled for something like this, but considering the ease at which he almost usurped power, maybe it’s best to not make unnecessary demands..."
 flavor_carn.9.a: "Let's hope for a calmer tomorrow."

#royal values
 flavor_carn.10.t: "Royal values"
 flavor_carn.10.d: "“The grand gathering, you say?” His tone is mocking, almost sneering, as if looking down at a civilian feebly asking the soldier to spare his family. Which might not be all that far from the truth, in this situation. Eventually, he sighs, and says simply, “let me discuss it with my countrymen, and i’ll come back to you, peasant.”"
 flavor_carn.10.a: "It’s a pretty simple request…"

#all the small things
 flavor_carn.11.t: "All the small things"
 flavor_carn.11.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been having restless dreams for the past week, all consisting of the same repeated sequence of events. In the dreams, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe]'s walking on a dirt path - it's pitch black, not even the stars in the sky above being visible, yet somehow [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe]'s still able to see in the general area around [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] walks for what feels like an eternity, never veering off the path, until suddenly [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe]'s stopped by someone, or something, at the entrance to what looks like a large sheep pen. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can't see the person, if it even is a person, that stopped [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] but the command is clear: go in. And so [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] does. Inside the pen are a number of other people, all dressed in royal garb vaguely similar to the one [Root.Monarch.GetName] also wears on a daily basis, but never has [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] been able to recognize any one of the people. Once [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe]'s fully inside the pen, it closes behind [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] - and the dream ends, only for it to come back the next night."
 flavor_carn.11.a: "It's a bad omen - we need to be careful."
 flavor_carn.11.b: "They're just dreams, what's the worst that could happen?"

#the carnian liberation army
 flavor_carn.12.t: "The Carnian Liberation Army"
 flavor_carn.12.d: ""We'll fight them in the fields, we'll cary the fight in our parts, whatever march we may face, we shan't tarry their black hearts", goes the chant of the Carnian Liberation Army as they march through the countryside. A loosely organized organization of independence fighters and believers in the Carnian soul, they're legally declared a terrorist organization by the Reyllean government - though that doesn't stop them from having wide-ranging support among the peoples all throughout the lands. Their demands are simple; give independence to the Caeronate, and crush the subjugators. Lately, their influence has grown considerably, to the point that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has started hearing their name thrown around in Lestrian political circles. Though we can't officially support the organization, there are non-official conduits through which they can be funded and propped up, if we so desire - though the consequences may be large if the Reylleans find out."
 flavor_carn.12.a: "Fund them covertly, in order to bolster our shot at independence."
 flavor_carn.12.b: "Why continue working in the shadows?"
 flavor_carn.12.c: "We're better off without them."

#wayshrines
 flavor_carn.13.t: "Wayshrines"
 flavor_carn.13.d: "[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] - the Carnian court inquisitor - has come to [Root.Monarch.GetName] with a suggestion that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] claims could, if implemented well, significantly expand the reach of Aegmerism in our home region - in short, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] wants to set up shrines to the saints that criss-cross our country, with the goal of potentially converting weary travellers to the Aegmerist faith. As Aegmerism is not fully entrenched in our lands yet, it could be something to consider, and maybe something to keep the churches satisfied."
 flavor_carn.13.a: "Let's see where it goes."
 flavor_carn.13.b: "Shrines? We can do better than that."
 flavor_carn.13.c: "It's a waste of time."

 #family bonds
 flavor_carn.14.t: "Family bonds"
 flavor_carn.14.d: "The court in Evansyllo is buzzing with activity, like always - messengers, diplomats and royal courtiers flowing in and out of the palace like worker bees around their hive. Today, however, is a special day, for everyone involved. Not too long ago the Carnians were despised in these parts, seen as rebellious problem-makers seconds from declaring independence, or seeking alliances with the Audaladae up north. Now, however, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has ascended to being a second hand of the Reyllean king [A12.Monarch.GetName], and numerous Elernels are mingling with the other noble houses of Reyllea. Despite the added bureaucracy, many are enjoying the change in tone compared to our previous status - and soon, it may bring additional benefits. In an activity lull, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is summoned to the throne. Bowing down [Root.Monarch.GetSheShe] asks simply, "my liege, how many i help you?".\n\n[A12.Monarch.GetName] sighs deeply, before responding. "[Root.Monarch.GetName], I want you to take my daughter's hand in marriage. Not only for the unity of my dear Reyllea - but for me. We're friends, as much as I can't admit that to my courtiers, and I care for you. Every respectable monarch needs a wife and well, my daughter, she's growing old. Too old, unfortunately, for most charlatans around the world. But I trust that you're better, I really do. It would help both of us, tremendously. If nothing else, I ask that you consider my offer."Though the Reyllean monarch didn't state it outright - no doubt about it due to the other people in the room - marrying their daughter would unite the houses of De Reyllea and Elernel, something that might be beneficial for the state. At the same time though, there might be ulterior motives to all of this..."
 flavor_carn.14.a: "My liege, I graciously accept your offer."
 flavor_carn.14.b: "My liege, i'm afraid this won't be possible..."

#swamp of royalty
 flavor_carn.15.t: "Swamp of royalty"
 flavor_carn.15.d: "In politics, there is only one rule - whoever can ruin you, will ruin you. The time since the wedding was first put into plan has been a hectic one, for both parties. In order to live up to the grand event that it will be for both houses, a similarly gargantuan amount of preparation for the week of festivities leading up to the ceremony itself has been conducted, with several hundred guests planning on arriving. In the Lestrian palace, however, the mood is currently anything but positive. In all of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s excitement to potentially put an Elernel on the line to Reyllean succession, something had slipped under the table unnoticed. Due to an obscure clause in the Reyllean succession code, the marriage planned wouldn't unite the houses of Elernel and De Reyllea, but instead simply make the Elernels a branch of the De Reyllea - something with significantly less prestige, and more importantly, something that would disqualify any potential Lestrian heirs from claiming the throne. It's a bad situation, in all aspects. Did the Reyllean monarch know this? It's unclear, but it's entirely possible. What matters in the present is - how shall the situation be dealt with?"
 flavor_carn.15.a: "Confront the Reyllean monarch."
 flavor_carn.15.b: "They deceived us! Send a letter - we're calling off the wedding."

#kneeling on spiked knees
 flavor_carn.16.t: "Kneeling on spiked knees"
 flavor_carn.16.d: "The monarch felt imposing, too imposing, as [A12.Monarch.GetSheHim] looked down from the gilded throne. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had been keenly aware of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] status as a vassal, a lesser junior partner before, but in this moment - confronting someone in such a way made it abundantly clear who was the one that held the true power; made it abundantly clear who could, at any moment, call for the guards to take this faint little Elernel away to be executed in the city, or thrown into a dungeon never to be seen again. The power imbalance could be felt in the air, setting like heavy stones in a lake, yet there was no backing out. There was a single goal to be achieved, to be negotiated towards. Any show of weakness would just make the situation that much more difficult. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] opened [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mouth to speak, something suddenly figuratively hit the back of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throat like an arrow, penetrating deep into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind and settling there, burrowing, ever deeper. A realization that..."
 flavor_carn.16.a: "How can you claim to have any leverage when you can't even manage your own citizenry?"
 flavor_carn.16.b: "A disease-riddled swamp-man has more prestige than you. Bow, Maybe you'll be shown mercy."
 flavor_carn.16.c: "Your dynasty is pure filth - Save what little honor you have left and scram, dog."
 flavor_carn.16.e: "Preserve your dignity, and leave. It's the most you can do. You can't win this."
 flavor_carn.16.f: "Tell me this - who is really in charge?"

#fate of the elernels
 flavor_carn.17.t: "Fate of the Elernels"
 flavor_carn.17.d: "It's over. [Root.Monarch.GetName] wasn't good enough, plain and simple. Or maybe it was the country, the courtiers, who knows - what matters is, something buckled, and the whole dynasty came crashing down with it, like a skull under the pressure of a hammer now nothing's left except viscera in wake and misery. The guards were called, as they always would be. All the blame placed on a single person. But what does it matter? Soon the Elernels shall be no more - relegated to a footnote in the annals of history, like so many other dynasties. It didn't have to come to this, yet it did. And now, Carn is facing the consequences."
 flavor_carn.17.a: "History is cruel."

#the argument
flavor_carn.18.t: "The argument"
flavor_carn.18.d: "The belltower in Evansyllo rings, once. Down on the street a town crier calls out; he speaks of a war high up in the north, though scarcely anyone concerns themselves to listen to him. On the square a musician plays his lute, hoping for donations from passers-by's, unaware that he's the target of a murder plot that will when dusk comes spring into action - such is life. In the court, the argument nears its first hour. Centered on the relative power of the Elernels to the De Reyllea family, it seems to be going in circles, until [Root.Monarch.GetName] suddenly pivots to their mutual past in sparwood...\n\nAt two, a baker starts a discussion with his assistants concerning the rising cost of ingredients for their bread. The harvest has been poor this year, they say, and prices might rise even further this winter. Someone suggests substituting part of the flour with sawdust; surely no one would notice, right? The baker, reluctantly, agrees to the cost saving measure. Meanwhile, a knight in shining armor passes through the town, and upon hearing the bard's music is reminded of a past point in his life - a point in his life where she had things to worry about other than what feudal lord will call her to fight in petty local feuds next. Meanwhile, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has just brought up the question of popular support, something the Reyllean monarch has no answer to - yet. A bit later, [A12.Monarch.GetName] manages to switch the argument around to the decentralized politics of Haven, and how, in the grander scheme of things, maybe dynasties don't mean all that much. \n\nAt hour three of the argument, [A12.Monarch.GetName] gives up, his throat hoarse and tired. "I underestimated you," [A12.Monarch.GetSheHe] says, somewhat quietly. "I underestimated you in so many ways. And it's all made me realize something large - all of this, us standing together in this room, screaming at each other, it's all just a big coincidence. We could have been peasants, working in the fields, or mercenaries in an army, yet something decided that we should be here, right now. I wonder, sometimes - what is that? The church has its answer, of course, and who am I but not a believer in the Ether Flame - but it's curious".\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] agrees - it is a bit funny.  Life works in mysterious ways, more so when you aren't focusing on it - but more importantly, the Reyllean monarch has something to give, to concede. It's been long enough - surely the modicum of respect that has been exchanged could go towards something.\n\n[A12.Monarch.GetSheHe] takes several seconds to reply, before conceding. "You're right. Here's what's gonna happen - I don't have a daughter, much less one you can marry, as much as that pains me to admit a lie like that. I will still grant you the permission to organize a wedding, however - on your terms, as my vassal. It's the least I can do. So get out of my palace - before my mind is changed.""
flavor_carn.18.a: "Take your spoils."

#the blue wedding
 flavor_carm.19.t: "The blue wedding"
 flavor_carn.19.d: "Blue shining skies and verdant fields stretch as far as the eye can see - it's a summer wedding, as was requested; cornflowers dot the lands. [Root.Monarch.GetName], not wanting to steal the show from the couple, is standing among the crowds. Hundreds of people, most of them nobles and royals, are here, for though the soon-to-bes hold no significant power, merely being minor nobles of Reyllea and Carn, what they represent is something special. A unification of families, of old dynasties that centuries ago, fleeing from Sparwood together, are now united in full. At the front, an Aegmerist priest goes on to bless the couple. From the distance that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is standing at, it's hard to hear the words exactly - but it's not like it matters. As they finalize their vows, it's hard to focus on the cheering when all that's on the mind of the Carnian royal is one thing - they won, and there's no going back."
 flavor_carn.19.a: "To glory!"

#disgraced royals
 flavor_carn.20.t: "Disgraced royals"
 flavor_carn.20.d: "It's been a great many years since [Root.Monarch.GetName] last conversed with their former overlords in the dynasty of De Reyllea - the once mighty Reylleans, at one point thought unstoppable, is now a mere shell of its former self after undergoing all manner of crises and internal disasters, no small part being that of the Carnian independence war. Though they have numerous times attempted to re-enforce their will upon the Caeronate, at no point have they attempted to converse with the great Caeron himself since independence - until now. A man enters the Lestrian palace, seeking an audience with the Caeron. Ragged and haggardly, the guards assumed he was a mere beggar, and as is custom forwarded the matter of how to deal with the poor to the Caeron; it's not until he bows before the throne and starts talking that [Root.Monarch.GetName] realizes that this is no person down on their luck, even if that surely is the case as well. He is, in fact, royal, or rather formerly royal. The son of the current Reyllean king, in fact, now disgraced after an incident he refuses to talk about, out of shame. What really matters though, is his requests; he wants to take the throne, overthrow his father and become king again. And, in return, he'll become a loyal subject of Carn. A decent proposal, perhaps, if we want to commit to it - though it might end up being a costly war."
 flavor_carn.20.a: "Accept his request."
 flavor_carn.20.b: "We're better off not getting involved. "
