 donsktopt_primer.1.t: "Military in Crisis"
 donsktopt_primer.1.d: "Since our great fracture over policy in the Trillium War, tensions between Donskopt and the Order Knossos have been at an all time high. For centuries, the Knossians stood side by side with Donsktopt in their defense of the Republic and upholding their mutual interests. However, come the onslaught of the Trillium War, relations became strained to say the least. The Knossian Order desired to ally with Bardonia, their Dandelist brethren, whereas the Republic was split between neutrality and supporting the rest of the League in their defense of Urnu-Arrak. Ultimately the dispute became so heated that the Knossians left court in Donskopt, and retreated into their holds along the Eastern reaches. Following the defeat of the Coalition in the Trillium War, Knossos became even further entrenched in their disdain for the vacillating bureaucrats in Donskopt who had kept them from a seat at the victory table. Each side has tried reaching out to the other to find agreement, but thus far, to no avail. Now, tensions are soaring and reconciliation seems a far off fantasy. Donskopt scambles to fix their reliance on mercenaries and rebuild a proper professional army, whilst Knossos consolidates greater power on the frontier. All the while, onlookers gaze on as it appears yet another Vastallosi Conflict looms on the horizon"
