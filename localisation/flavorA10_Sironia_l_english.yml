 flavor_sironia.1.t: "Land negotiations"
 flavor_sironia.1.d: "Merely a couple decades ago - still fresh within the memory of every Sironian - we lost. The Reylleans, moving out of Rhodia like an unstoppable horde, pillaged and destroyed our country until finally, at the cities of Althivir and Namarrak, they were stopped for good. Negotiating is pointless - they are brutes, wild savages who do not care for morals and do not have a word for honor. Yet, we have just been presented with a golden opportunity. The duchy of Carn, previously under Reyllean management, has now broken free, and in their independence moves they managed to get a hold of the sea-side port of Ilivian, one of the last cities conquered by the Reylleans in that war so many years ago. They seem significantly more amenable to negotiations than their former Reyllean overlords, and may indeed seek to impart some manner of revenge on their old overlords by giving more power to their biggest rival. We can send a negotiating party to Lestria, in order to start discussions on the topic of Illeviane; maybe they can even give us some compensation for the decades-long occupation, in order to help us rebuild the still war-torn city."
 flavor_sironia.1.a: "Send the negotiating party - what’s the worst that could happen?"
 flavor_sironia.1.b: "There’s no point. We’ll simply take the city by other means."
 flavor_sironia.2.t: "Negotiations continue"
 flavor_sironia.2.d: "After a long journey up through the continent, our negotiating party has finally returned - bearing bad news. The Carnians - clearly inheriting several despicable qualities from Reyllea and subverting our good expectations for them in the process - want money. They want us to pay for our own lands. How despicable! As the news enters the courtroom it slowly starts dissolving into chaos, and arguing, until Archon [Root.Monarch.GetName] finally puts a stop to things and demands silence. We will examine our options carefully, they say. And we will not be swindled for more than that town is worth."
 flavor_sironia.2.a: "Give in to their demands. Ilivian is worth the price."
 flavor_sironia.2.b: "Those dogs! They will pay for this!"
