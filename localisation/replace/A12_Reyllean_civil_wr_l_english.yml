 reyllea_dissolution_tt: "The noble Kingdom of Reyllea will be dissolved, its lands divided among the newly-independent states that formed in the wake of the civil war. "
 ile_de_reyllea_tt: "We'll occupy a large chunk of Reyllean land but otherwise leave the rest as a self-governing territory, under our own dominion and control."
 rcw.1.t: "The life of a soldier"
 rcw.1.d: "A soldier needs three primary things to function effectively: A superior to take orders from, a lesser to take their frustration out on, and supplies - primarily, food. A starving soldier can't march, let alone fight battles or conduct sieges. Unfortunately for us, the average soldiers definition of 'starvation' lies at a much lower threshold than that which her generals would prefer. Simply put - the soldiers are complaining about a lack of adequate provisions, and if we don't do something soon this whole war may be over alot sooner than any of us would really want."
 rcw.1.a: "Our soldiers need food, so give them!"
 rcw.1.b: "They complain too much, our provisions are more than adequate!"
 rcw.1.c: "Teach them how to forage off of the land."
 rcw.2.t: "The Reyllean Civil War"
 rcw.2.d: "No-one quite knows what broke the camels back when it came to the civil war; whether it was the massacre at Lantois, the Reylleans ignoring the difficulties and plights of their vassals or simply something that had been brewing since we all settled in this dastardly place. What matters is, the government in Evansyllo has become fundamentally incapable of coexisting with its co-governments in the vassals, which has led us to where we are now. Yesterday, the [vassal that declared war] army crossed over their borders into Reyllea, signalling the official start of the Reyllean civil war - and now, there's no turning back."
 rcw.2.a: "Let the massacre begin"
 rcw.3.t: "The Lantois Massacre"
 rcw.3.d: "The situation is grim, to say the least. Reports from the site, though highly varied, speak of bodies littering the streets, burned-down buildings and children being forcibly separated from their mothers - though not all of it may be true, what is known is this; Several days ago, a group of people entered the Carnian town of Lantois, near the Sironian border. The townspeople are insisting they were Reyllean soldiers, perhaps rogue, while other local groups are claiming they were, in fact, sent by the same court in Lestria that administers the town. For the Carnians, the matter is simple - they see it as another event supporting the more and more commonly held notion that the Reylleans are not compatriots of the Carnian people but are, in fact, oppressors. An independence movement is growing, and fast. The choices we make today may have large effects further down the road."
 rcw.3.a: "Blame it on the Carnians."
 rcw.3.b: "Blame it on local Reyllean groups."
 rcw.3.c: "Blame it on the military."
 rcw.3.e: "Blame it on no-one."
 rcw.3.f: "Take personal responsibility."
 rcw.4.t: "Siege of Evansyllo"
 rcw.4.d: "A crow flies over the city, watching, judging; below humans are scurrying around like ants on a hill, screaming. The city is ablaze, and after several months of siege the gates have finally been breached. The city - the beating heart of the empire - is now within our hands. The king, foolish enough to not flee when he had the choice to, sits in his palace, trapped and under our control. With Evansyllo being ours the civil war is now over - the only question remaining is, how do we proceed?"
 rcw.4.b: "Dissolve the kingdom."
 rcw.4.c: "Turn the king into a puppet."
 rcw.4.e: "Total control."
 rcw.5.t: "Siege of Lestria"
 rcw.5.d: "The once mighty red-brown walls of the city stand ruined and battered after months of heavy siege - the sky is tainted a sickly red from the fire and ash burning within. According to reports the Shaeron is gone from the city, likely having fled to Audal on a dark night never to return. Lestria - the seat of the once-mighty Carnian peoples - has fallen, and it is now once again under our subjugation. A question remains, however - how shall we deal with them?"
 rcw.5.a: "FVassalize them - return to the status-quo."
 rcw.5.b: "Integrate them fully into the kingdom."
 rcw.5.c: "Let them go free - with some concessions."
 rcw.6.t: "Siege of Ilivian"
 rcw.6.d: "Burning - acrid, foul, raw. The scent of death and misery hangs hard and foul in the air like a cloud just waiting to choke the besieging soldiers; people are fleeing, or rather, attempting to - it's unlikely many will make it very far. In the grand scheme of things it's a miracle that the city lasted for as long as it did, even if it was held alive a considerable amount by the port. But - all cities fall eventually. We found the dukes family hiding in the government building, cowering like the rats they are. How dare they rise up against us! But now, it's in the past, and we need to decide ok what to do with them - and the city as a whole. "
 rcw.6.e: "Cede the territory to Sironia as a gesture of good will."
 rcw.7.t: "Siege of Rodéa"
 rcw.7.d: "Ah, the poor Rhodians, always running into some issue or another. How unfortunate - for them, not for us - that they just had to go and make a mountain out of a molehill. There are several advantages to putting your city and defensible positions on a large hill like the Rhodians decided to do all those years ago. One disadvantage however, that we've managed to considerably exploit during the siege, is that it makes getting supplies into the city considerably harder, especially if your city also happens to be placed on an island with no major ports and only one bridge connecting it to the mainland. After several months of siege the city of Rodéa is finally ours, likely after the inhabitants finally exhausted their supplies. But now the question is - what shall we do with them?"
 rcw.8.t: "Siege of Praesténne"
 rcw.8.d: "It didn't have to be this way - it really didn't. Yet, here we are. La Praèçe is a duchy of stubborn fools who don't know what's good for them. Or rather, was - suppose there's still a few scattered mountain villages, but that hardly counts as enough for a duchy... several months into the siege, the city - pretty much as if from nowhere - started burning. And it didn't stop burning, for seven days straight. At no point did we hear screams, and at no point did we find anyone trying to escape. Yet the strangest thing is that, once the city stopped burning and we entered, there were considerably fewer corpses around than there should have been... some people are suggesting the townsfolk fled through secretive underground tunnels, but as none have yet been found, these are merely rumours. And in the meantime, we need to figure out what to do with the ruins."
 rcw.8.a: "Try to rebuild as good as we can."
 rcw.8.b: "Invite settlers from the rest of the kingdom to rebuild."
 rcw.9.t: "Siege of Raevenne"
 rcw.9.d: "No parent should take pleasure in hitting their child, especially when that child has done such a good job growing up - but unfortunately, when attacked, you have to fight back. The duchy of Argvennes could be said to be - apart from ever-loyal Ilivian - to be the most stable and loyal vassal of the kingdom. Until the civil war, that is. It was a quick siege, fortunately - the walls were old and weak, being inherited from old Sagavir and scarcely repaired since then, yet the decision on what to do with the duchy remains a hard one. And no matter what we do, due to their previously held loyalties, we're likely to displease a large part of the government."
 rcw.9.e: "Forgive them - let them go free."
 rcw.10.t: "The Evansyllo Accords"
 rcw.10.d: "Thousands, tens of thousands, lie dead, wasted, rotting in the countryside, and for what? glory? nationalism? There is a hole in the kingdom of Reyllea, large and festering - it appeared when we first entered this wretched place, and it has not gone away nor will it go away for on the contrary it is growing, metaphorically eating away at each and every one of us - and some day, we will be swallowed, and there will be nothing left. But hey, there's celebrations to be had! Generals are dancing upon the blood-soaked ground, toasting to another bullet in reality, toasting to a resolution, an end. It's been five long years of hell, or maybe more, at some point mother time stopped keeping track. For all we know we could have been here for a thousand years, repeating the same battles over and over again, only for some cosmic flip of a dice to finally let us free. Yet the victors crave the spoils. So, dance! Rejoice! We're out of the fire. The populace eagerly awaits for when we'll throw them all collectively into the meat grinder again."
 rcw.10.a: "Anyone up for a repeat?"
 rcw.11.t: "Coalition of the bloody flower"
 rcw.11.d: "Among the vassals there is a growing animosity against Reyllea that, really, began growing the moment we fist stepped foot on this hell-spawn of a continent. From the moment the first ships landed and the invasion began, from the moment we began to butcher and subjugate every single thing that moved in our little part of the place that they call Aldovir, it's been growing. It's a feeling of utter contempt, for each other, but also for the people we subjugated. Its a feeling that drives us to try and find something to try and take our frustration out on, no matter the cost. And unfortunately for the Reyllean king, in a rare moment of unity, that target just now happens to be the king himself. It's a disgusting sort of peace, not fueled by any sort of shared ideology but instead by pure hatred, greed, misery in its pure and unadulterated form; hence, why we're sitting at this table, signing this document of war, of conquest, of bloody murder. There was a going back at some point, but it's long passed. And who are we to tempt fate?"
 rcw.11.a: "To murder!"
 rcw.11.b: "We shouldn't participate in this."
