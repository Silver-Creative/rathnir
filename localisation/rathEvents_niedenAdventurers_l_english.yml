 nieden_adventurers.1.title: "Winds of Adventure"
 nieden_adventurers.1.desc: "Nearly four decades ago, the Empire of the Soleannan fell. That great work, one cultivated by generations of dutiful Escharii, Solerii and many more such sons of Solaris.. was turned to ash in the blink of an eye. Banners fell, armies dissipated and nearly all of Asterien - the heartlands of the old Empire - ascended to the Luminarium, the Escharians' promised heaven-- or so they claim, at least. Nieden, the lands they have governed since time immemorial, was suddenly without crown or country and the many lords of Rathnir were quick to notice. Lords disgraced in petty wars, adventurers looking for a feat of renown, downtrodden peoples seeking a new home and expeditions made to retrieve old artifacts and riches-- they all poured into the dead soils of Nieden and, eventually, found their own little slice of land to call home... The Dandelion Wars have ended. Nearly all of Rathnir lies wrecked, exhausted or otherwise depleted-- yet we, harmless folk in ruined lands, have thankfully managed to dodge the flames of war. With the world at war, few rulers - if any - ever considered it to be prudent to waste resources on wrangling a poor adventurer's ill-gotten gains from their weak hands. There was a war to fight, armies to marshall and cities to siege-- but that is no longer the case. As the great realms of Rathnir heal and rebuild, so too will they begin to let their eyes wander, to size up their neighbours once more-- if we are to be caught in their sight unprepared, the consequences would be disastrous."
