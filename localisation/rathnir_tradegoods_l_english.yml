 #Rathnir Resources
 redstone:0 "Redstone"
 redstoneDESC:0 "Redstone is a strange red dust that is able to transmit information and some forms of magic. It is naturally found in large red crystals, both on the surface and deep underground. The world's greatest redstone mine is in Santuary, where building-size crystals grow on the island by the thousands."
 lapis_lazuli:0 "Lapis Lazuli"
 lapis_lazuliDESC:0 "A beautiful blue stone used for dye. In Rathnir, however, Lapis's greatest use is in that of enchanting, where its internal structure is useful for trapping and binding magic to an object, while still allowing for these properties to be removed."
 silver:0 "Silver"
 silverDESC:0 "The shine of silver is deceiving- Just as dangerous and integral as gold to Rathniri treasuries, Silver was most often mined along the Wyngale river and in the North. While silver has since fallen out of favor in coinage after the Trillium War, it has given its name to both the region of Argentor, and the Sterling Crownlands."
 obsidian:0 "Obsidian"
 obsidianDESC:0 "Rare. Beautiful. Hard. Three words are all you need to use to use to describe obsidian. Prized by fort builders due to its legendary durability, by aristocrats for its striking beauty, and by mages for its more esoteric properties, it should come to no surprise that its demand causes more than a few businessmen to run the risk of mining around- and in- volcanos."
 cheese:0 "Cheese"
 cheeseDESC:0 "Cheese is a delicacy, particularly popular in Ryzani countries where it is served as part of every meal. Perhaps due to the complex and risky fermentation process, it has failed to find demand just about anywhere else."
 ice:0 "Ice"
 iceDESC:0 "Ice is merely frozen water... usually. As the pure essence of cold, however, the magically-minded people of Rathnir have nigh endless uses for it, from divination to evocation to even teleportation. Despite its more practical uses, Ice is procured by the nobles of many countries for use in sculptures."
 fruits:0 "Fruits"
 fruitsDESC:0 "Fruit, ranging from such exotic delicacies as Cupuacu to the mundane apple, forms a key part of the economy in many regions. Though generally not as productive as grains for feeding large numbers of people, fruits often provide crucial vitamins otherwise lacking in grain-based diets and provide a welcome sweetness in addition to being easily stored in the form of jams & preserves."
 potions:0 "Potions"
 potionsDESC:0 "Brewing potions is perhaps the oldest industry there is. Since the first hag dropped a herb in a cauldron and bottled the result, Rathniri society has depended on the creation, trade, and use of potions. This has made skilled breweries rich beyond their means, even giving some the political ability to act as independent countries."
 lumber:0 "Lumber"
 lumberDESC:0 "Lumber is a type of wood that has been processed into beams and planks, a stage in the process of wood production. Lumber is mainly used for structural purposes but has many other uses as well."
 horses:0 "Horses"
 horsesDESC:0 "Coveted for their use in enhancing and providing mobility to armies, nations with access to horses possess a significant advantage in warfare, logistics, agriculture, husbandry and many other fields."
 beer:0 "Beer"
 beerDESC:0 "Beer is one of the most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer often produced by monks in monasteries and mainly brewed from cereal grains with additions of honey and fruits."
