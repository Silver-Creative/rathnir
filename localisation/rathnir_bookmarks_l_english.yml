 ASHES_OF_THE_COALITION_NAME: "Ashes of the Coalition"
 ASHES_OF_THE_COALITION_DESC: "Never has Rathnir seen so much wanton death and destruction as it has in the last year. First, the troubles at Raykara led the Escharians to cast away their empire and worldly possessions for a promised afterlife in the Luminarium, devastating not only the land and those not fortunate enough to ascend, but also the very fabric of magic itself. Then, sensing an opportunity, the Bardonians seized their chance: judging themselves superior to all other nations, their senate brazenly declared a multitude of wars. Drunk off their first victories, they began to act rashly, starting offensives and campaigns they couldn't possibly win. Sure enough, their hubris got the better of them, and now the giant of Sýltör sleeps once more. A great many realms of Rathnir now lie drained and weakened, the balance of power has irreversibly changed and many new challenges will soon arrive: will these old and famous states pull through and become prosperous once more, or will they be crushed under the weight of this new age?"
 SONS_OF_SAGAVIR_NAME: "Sons of Sagavir"
 SONS_OF_SAGAVIR_DESC: "Nearly a century ago, Great Sagavir, an empire which had ruled over the many lands of Aldovir since time immemorial, collapsed. Hampered by its byzantine courts and plotting nobles and pressured by an unprecedented wave of calamity after calamity, it fell and, amidst the chaos, out came a handful of new fledgling states. Yet, these new nations fared little better and were soon engulfed by similar troubles as their predecessor, presenting the knightly people of Reyllea beyond the Astyllean Sea with a unique opportunity.. Nearly three decades ago, they crossed the Astyllean Sea with over fifty thousand men and laid all of Raêll to waste, supplanting its houses and banners with their own. Yet, it seems that their drive has slowed, and they may soon face troubles of their own... Will the sons of Sagavir recover from this dreadful century and rekindle the flames of their predecessor, or will they be slain by the invaders and extinguished for good?"
