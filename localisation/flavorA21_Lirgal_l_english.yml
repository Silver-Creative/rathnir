 lirgal_happs.1.d: "Rumours of a caravan have travelled the countries of Alteniquia. Coming from the continent of Syltör, it seems to be made of a variety of peoples, all following a similar creed and faith. On their way, they have befriended and traded with all Alteniquians, but quickly left every city and town they passed through."
 lirgal_happs.1.a: "A most curious happening."
 lirgal_happs.1.a.tt: "The Second Seraan caravan travels through Alteniquia, hoping to find a new land to inhabit."
