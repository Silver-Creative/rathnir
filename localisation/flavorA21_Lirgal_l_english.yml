 lirgal_happs.1.t: "Rumours of a Caravan"
 lirgal_happs.1.d: "Rumours of a caravan have travelled the countries of Alteniquia. Coming from the continent of Syltör, it seems to be made of a variety of peoples, all following a similar creed and faith. On their way, they have befriended and traded with all Alteniquians, but quickly left every city and town they passed through."
 lirgal_happs.1.a: "A most curious happening."
 lirgal_happs.1.a.tt: "The Second Seraan caravan travels through Alteniquia, hoping to find a new land to inhabit."
 lirgal_happs.t.201: "The demand of the Lirgalyn"
 lirgal_happs.d.201: "Though people talk of Meydan with no end, everyone knows that Meydan is no better than a wasteland. Moreover, a group of new peoples has settled in its land - they claim to have found ruins of a city of yore that belonged to them, and wish to develop the land."
 lirgal_happs.2.a: "Pah! That land is more trouble than it's worth, either way. Let them have it!"
 lirgal_happs.2.b: "A new city arises? That will probably turn out better than this mess ..."
 lirgal_happs.2.c: "Let the Lirgalyn have their land. There is no harm in giving, sometimes."
 lirgal_happs.2.d: "May the Lunar City-State of Lirgal thrive!"
 lirgal_happs.2.e: "A new city, and it demands autonomy? Perhaps - but we shall limit it."
 lirgal_happs.2.f: "A new city arises. Glory to the City of Lirgal."
 lirgal_happs.2.g: "Those are [Root.GetAdjective] lands and they shall remain [Root.GetAdjective] lands!"
