carvay_flavor.1.t: "Port Ravenus Revolt!"
carvay_flavor.1.d: "Port Ravenus always served as Carvay's bread basket since the founding of it allowing Carvay citizens to remove one of their biggest household expenses or significantly reduce the amount of money they must spend on remaining alive. this used to allow us to focus on luxury trading rather than farming. However that changed with the revolt of Essendor of Ravenus who disobeyed the Carvay government due to their lack of action during the Dandelion wars. since the dandelion wars are over shall we march down and claim what is rightfully ours?"
carvay_flavor.1.a: "For the Doge!"
carvay_flavor.1.a.tt: "this will put us at war with Ravenus!!!"
carvay_flavor.1.b: "We must bide our time"
carvay_flavor.1.b.tt: "We will never be able to claim all of Ravenus if we wait!"
