 essukdalad_nation_title: "Proclaim Theios-Essukdal"
 essukdalad_nation_desc: "The peoples of Essukdal are lost. Ever since the humilliating defeat of Yimmu-Audal at the hands of the Escharians and the subsequent miserable years of occupation, Essukdal has lacked unity, stability and, above all, purpose. Drowning in their hubris, many have tried, citing the need to band around false gods or common heritage. And then, they all failed. It appears that only we know the unabolishable truth: that these lands shall only know guidance under the light of Theios and that, by our value, we have claimed the mantle of its herald."

 astyllean_nation_title: "Proclaim the Empire of Astyllea"
 astyllean_nation_desc: "The balance of power is destroyed, and we stand triumphantly over its ashes. There are still old men and women living under our banners who remember the times we were but an insignificant, petty duchy in a forgotten corner of vast Alteniquia. Oh, how far we have come: now, merchants take entire moons to travel from one end of our empire to the other and countless old and famous states have fallen before us. It is time we style ourselves in colors befitting of our new status; it is time for us to proclaim Astyllea."

 aldoviri_nation_title: "Form the Aldoviri Nation"
 aldoviri_nation_desc: "For decades, the lands of Aldovir have known little peace, being embroiled in war after war, rebellion after rebellion. Those who ruled over it have always sought to bring others under their banner, to stand stronger and mightier in the name of some token ideal, be it common faith, heritage or some other nonsense. All of them have failed, and we refuse to follow in their footsteps. Aldovir will be united by our hand, not for bringing together some handful of devouts, or peasants who speak similar tongues, but because this is our land - our shared homeland! - and together we can defend it against the scourges of Rathnir, faith and heritage be damned."

 sagaviri_nation_title: "Rekindle the Flames of Sagavir"
 sagaviri_nation_desc: "Nearly a century ago, the Empire of Sagavir fell. Pestered by a relentless onslaught of natural disasters and high troubles, the once-great state crumbled on its own weight and gave way to a myriad of squabbling successor states. At the time, the people of Aldovir thought that these newly heralded nations would pave the way to a bright future, that they would make good of their renewed hope and restore prosperity to the land. Oh, how wrong they were. After many dreadful decades of near-sighted leaders devastating the realms over petty causes, barbarian invaders from beyond the seas reaping our livelihoods and many such tragedies, we have perservered and now stand at the precipice. It is time to rekindle the old Empire, resume our glorious days and put an end to this pitiful age."

 audalad_nation_title: "Restore Imperial Grace"
 audalad_nation_desc: "It has been a harsh century for the Audalad people. No sooner were we at our zenith, our banners flying proudly above such faraway lands as Ardat and Soumere did the Escharians see our empress' corruption as an opportunity and invade, seizing our sovereignty and plunging us into decades worth of misery and unrest. Yet, despite all of that, we have prevailed. The shores of the Geshem Bay now lie green and lush with life, as do those of the Gray Bay; the Western Territories have been returned to the fold and the unruly Anòshphites have been firmly educated of the benefits of our rule. We have, beyond doubt, outgrown our dark ages, and it is time we look the part: raise the gold and cyan, boys! Yimmu-Audal has returned!"
